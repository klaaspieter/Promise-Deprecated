# Promise

This is a very experimental objective-c implementation of the Javascript Promises/A+ spec.


- Is it ready?

    It implements the entire Promises/A+ spec so in that sense, yes it's ready.

- Should I use this?

    That's up to you, I haven't so far.

- Why not?

    Although I built this with the intention of actually using it, after finishing it I'm not convinced of the public API anymore.
    I encourage you to check out [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) as an alternative more objective-c like solution.
